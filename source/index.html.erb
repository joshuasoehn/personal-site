    <div class="flex--sixtyfive">
      <p>Based in Berlin, Germany, I'm focused on creating simple-to-use, human-centered designs. I believe in doing good work without rushing, working <em>with</em> instead of <em>for</em> clients and putting quality over quantity.</p>
      <p>I'm most influenced and inspired by Minimalism, Scandinavian (especially Danish) design and individuals like Dieter Rams, Kenâ€™ya Hara and Bruno Munari.</p>
