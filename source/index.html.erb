  <h1 class="hero-headline m--b--80">Hey, my name is Joshua Söhn and I'm a Designer, creating digital software for human beings. I enjoy working at the intersection of design & technology.</h1>

  <div class="m--b--80">
    <p>Based in Berlin, Germany, I'm focused on creating simple-to-use, human-centered designs. I believe in doing good work without rushing, working <em>with</em> instead of <em>for</em> clients and putting quality over quantity.</p>
    <p>I'm most influenced and inspired by Minimalism, Scandinavian (especially Danish) design and individuals like Dieter Rams, Ken’ya Hara and Bruno Munari.</p>
    <p>I'm currently working as a Designer for <a href="http://kontist.com">Kontist&#x2197;&#xFE0E;</a>, building a better banking experience for freelancers. I'm responsible for Brand, Marketing and Product Design. I occasionally also do Front-End Development.</p>
    <p>On the side I'm currently making sharing and managing contacts simpler.</p>
    <p>My work has been featured on some various sites such as <em>Siteinspire, Design Made In Germany, Smashing Magazine, The Gallery, Typeverywhere, 365 Awesome Designers</em> and <em>Nice Portfolio</em>.</p>
