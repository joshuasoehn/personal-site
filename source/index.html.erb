    <h5 class="flex--third">Profile</h5>

    <div class="flex--third">
      <p>Based in Berlin, Germany I'm focused on creating simple-to-use, human-centered designs. I believe in doing good work without rushing, working <em>with</em> instead of for clients and putting quality over quantity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flex--third">
    <p>
      I'm most influenced and inspired by Minimalism, Scandinavian (especially Danish) design and individuals like Dieter Rams, Ken’ya Hara and Bruno Munari.
